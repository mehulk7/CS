Welcome everyone.
I am Aditya and i'll be showing you how to setup and run my very own project stickman.
First of all let me introduce to you my group members Mehul,Shravan and Gopal.
For running this project we need SDL libraries so first i am going to teach you to install SDL libraries.
For that you need to go to www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php.
Then proceed to development libraries and download SDL2-devel-2.0.3-mingw32.tar.gz file
which i've already downloaded here.
Next we require SDL mixer for that we have to go www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ and similarly proceed
to development libraries and download SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.0-mingw.tar.gz.
And we also need SDL image for that we need to go to www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ and similarly 
development libraries and download SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.0-mingw.tar.gz.
Now you need to extract these tar.gz files into their respective folders.
Next i'll show u how to set them up in code blocks.
Go to settings -> compiler -> linker settings and u need to put these linkerers here so just type them out.
Next go to search directories -> compiler and add them one by one. Use the 64 bit. next the SDL mixer and
then image.
Then go to linker and add the libraries. Press OK.
Next u need to get the main folder of my project which is over here in the form of tar and extract all of 
its contents into this folder here.
Open this folder go to source -> SDL and copy all of its contents and paste it here similarly do with images
and audio.
Go to code blocks and create a new file and save it in the same destination of this folder.
next u need to copy all the codes which is over here and then build it.
Now its ready to run.
And thats it hope u enjoyed it and thanks for watching this video!!
